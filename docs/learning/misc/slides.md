### Presentation Slides
- slides are written in HTML, powered by [**RevealJS**](https://revealjs.com/) library

Keyboard shortcuts for the slides:

| Key | Action | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| N, SPACE | Next slide | 
| P | Previous slide |
| ← , H | Navigate left |
| → , L | Navigate right |
| ↑ , K | Navigate up |

| Home , ⌘/CTRL ← | First slide |
| End , ⌘/CTRL → | Last slide |
| F | Fullscreen |
| ESC, O | Slide overview |

#### Browser support
- RevealJS used as a presentation framework supports all browsers since 2012 (Chrome 24+, Firefox 4+, IE10+, Edge, Safari, Opera)
- custom styles were tested against Chrome 77 and Firefox 69 (Windows, Linux and Android platforms)
- if you bump into anything that appears wrongly aligned, or worse, broken, feel free to notify the lecturer

### PDF Export
- you should use `Google Chrome` since it has got a built-in PDF export and the slides were optimized for it
- go to the main page, select a lecture down below and click on the print icon label
  - alternatively, navigate to a presentation you want to export either on your localhost or on the live environment and put `?print-pdf` as a query string (e.g. `localhost:1234/lecture01.html?print-pdf`)
- in this mode, you will see all slides aligned vertically, stripped out of all visual effects and glowing backgrounds
- press right mouse button, select `print`
- select `Save as PDF` as the Destination
- wait for the preview to be generated and click on `Save`
