## Semester Project
### Requirements
- The game must run on the web.
- Students must work on the game individually or in pairs.
- The game concept must be approved by the instructor (during the "Finalization of Project Requirements" phase).
- Game assets must be taken from the Public Domain (including assets generated by AI).
- The game must include at least one non-trivial **technical** mechanic.
- The game can be developed using a game engine or graphic library. For educational purposes, the COLFIO library was created [COLFIO](https://colf.io/).
- In the case of using the COLFIO library (or an engine with ECS architecture), the game must fully utilize the ECS pattern (Entity-Component-System).

### Additional Requirements
- Create the game on the faculty's [GitLab](https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz) with the name `NI-APH`, accessible via `gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/<username>/NI-APH`.
- In addition to the game itself, the repository should include:
  - README with a brief description of the game and installation instructions.
  - Architecture diagram (as a PNG/JPG image).
  - **Clear and regular commits**.
  - Author's name in `package.json`, if using JavaScript/TypeScript, or in other manifest files.
  - Author's name in the license file.
- The game must have a title displayed in both the HTML header and the game itself.
- The repository should not contain any redundant data (especially `node_modules`, `.unitypackage`, `Obj/`, `Temp/`, etc.). Use `.gitignore`.

### Technical Game Mechanics
- Must involve a mechanic that is non-trivial from a programming perspective.
- Examples include:
  - Replay mechanic.
  - Hierarchical pathfinding.
  - Rope climbing.
  - Procedurally generated objects.

### COLF.IO
- Originally ECSLite and previously APHLib.
- [Library](https://colf.io) created for the study and teaching of component-based architecture.
- It is an extension of the PixiJS graphics library, adding a component architecture following the ECS pattern.
- It is available as an external npm package `colfio` or as a boilerplate project [ecs-template](https://github.com/APHGames/ecs-template).

### ggBlaster
- If the game runs on **ggBlaster**, it is possible to earn up to 10 bonus points.
- To have your semester project run on the arcade machine `ggBlaster`, it must meet the following requirements:
  - The game is controlled only by the keyboard, mapped to the arcade machine's buttons.
    - The arcade machine includes a joystick (4 positions) and 8 game buttons for each of the two players, as well as two additional functional buttons (e.g., menu/back).
  - The game is designed for two players.
  - The style and genre match the arcade gaming style (e.g., adventure games are not suitable).
  - The game is optimized for a resolution of 720x576 and 50 frames per second.
  - The game runs smoothly on Raspberry 4 (overclocked to 1800 MHz), using the Chromium browser platform.

## Oral Examination
- There will be no fixed date for the oral examination; it will be conducted individually based on students' availability in room TH-A:1455 in January and February.
- The examination will involve discussions on various topics from the lectures, especially those marked with orange and red lightbulbs in the slides.
